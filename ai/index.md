This course introduces the basic concepts and techniques of Artificial Intelligence, the sub area of Computer Science devoted to creating software and hardware to get computers to do things that would be considered intelligent as if people did them. Artificial intelligence has had an active and exciting history and is now a mature area of Computer Science. All serious programmers and software engineers should know about the major Artificial Intelligence techniques, which are regarded by many the core knowledge of any Computer Science degree. This course will teach that core knowledge, including search, knowledge representation, Bayesian networks, automated planning, intelligent agents, and machine learning.


The course will use the famous Russell & Norving ["Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach"](http://libgen.lc/ads.php?md5=FDDAC27ADB8598B2AD709F1D8B31BD90).
