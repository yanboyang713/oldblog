# DevOps Beginner's Guide


## Overview {#overview}

In this blog, I discussed **what is DevOps**, and why it has **gained** so much **traction** in the IT industry lately.


## What Is DevOps? {#what-is-devops}

It is a combination of practices that **streamline** the **automation** and **integration** of processes between the **software development** and **IT teams**. This will help them to **build**, **test**, and **release software** in a faster and more reliable way.


### Purpose {#purpose}

The term was formed by combining the words **"development"** and **"operations"** and signifies a cultural shift that **helps bridge the gap between the development and operation teams**.


### Goal {#goal}

The **goal** of DevOps is to change and improve the relationship by advocating better communication and collaboration between these two business units.


## DevOps Model For Teams {#devops-model-for-teams}

Teams using the DevOps model are able to evolve and improve their products at a higher rate over the organizations that use traditional processes. **Collaboration**, **Communication**, and **Integration** are the key elements of incorporating DevOps into any development and delivery setting.

This speed enables the teams (and in turn their organizations) to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

## DevOps Advantages {#devops-advantages}

Improvement of collaboration between all stakeholders from planning through delivery and automation of the delivery process in order to:

-   Increase deployment frequency
-   Achieve faster time to market
-   Decrease the failure rate of new releases
-   Shorten the lead time between fixes
-   Improve mean time to recovery

According to the State of DevOps Report, "high-performing IT organizations deploy 30x more frequently with 200x shorter lead times; they have 60x fewer failures and recover 168x faster."


## DevOps Principles {#devops-principles}

The phrase “The Three Ways” is used to describe the underlying principles of the DevOps movement.


### The First Way: Principles of Flow {#the-first-way-principles-of-flow}

The First Way states the following, about the flow of work:

-   Work should only flow in one direction
-   No known defect should be passed downstream
-   Always seek to increase the flow


### The Second Way: Principles of Feedback {#the-second-way-principles-of-feedback}

The Second Way describes the feedback process as the following:

-   Establish an upstream feedback loop
-   Shorten the feedback loop
-   Amplify the feedback loop

### The Third Way: Principles of Continuous Learning {#the-third-way-principles-of-continuous-learning}

The Third Way describes the environment and culture, as the following practices

-   Promote experimentation
-   Learn from success and failure
-   Constant improvement
-   Seek to achieve mastery through practice
