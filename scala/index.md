# Getting Started with Scala

## Overview

### Why need to learn Scala
1. Spark and Flink are memory-level big data computing framework are very important part of big data.
2. Spark and Flink are written in Scala. Therefore, in order to learn Spark and Flink better, you need to master the language Scala.
3. The rise of Spark drives the development of the Scala language!

### Scala history
Martin Odersky of the Federal Institute of Technology began designing Scala in 2001.
Martin Odyssky is a big fan of compilers and programming. After a long time of programming, he hopes to invent a
Language can make basic tasks like writing programs efficient and simple. So when you come into contact with the JAVA language, right JAVA, a portable language that runs on the Internet and has garbage collection, has generated great interest, so he decided combining the features of functional programming languages ​​into JAVA, two languages ​​(Pizza & Scala) were invented. Pizza and Scala have greatly promoted the development of the Java programming language. The generics of JDK5.0, enhanced for loops, automatic type conversion, etc., are all new features introduced from Pizza. Type inference and Lambda expressions of JDK8.0 are features introduced from Scala. The editors of JDK5.0 and JDK8.0 were written by Martin Odyssky, so Martin Odyssky alone. The fighting power is worthy of a Java development team.

### The relationship between Scala and Java
Generally speaking, people who learn Scala already know Java, and Scala is based on Java.

### Scala language features
Scala is a program that uses Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as its operating environment and combines the best features of object-oriented and functional programming. Statically typed programming languages ​​(static languages ​​need to be compiled in advance, such as: Java, c, c++, etc., dynamic languages ​​such as: js).

1. Scala is a multi-paradigm programming language. Scala supports object-oriented and functional programming. (Multi-paradigm means multiple programming methods The meaning of law. There are four programming methods: process-oriented, object-oriented, generic, and functional. )

2. Scala source code (.scala) will be compiled into Java bytecode (.class), and then run on the JVM, and can call existing The Java class library realizes the seamless connection of the two languages.

3. Scala is very simple and efficient as a language.

4. When designing Scala, Martin Odyssky referred to the design ideas of Java. It can be said that Scala is derived from Java. At the same time, Martin Odessky Deski also added his own thoughts and integrated the features of functional programming language into JAVA. Therefore, for students who have studied Java, As long as you understand the similarities and differences between Scala and Java in the process of learning Scala, you can quickly master the language of Scala.

## Set-up Scala development environment

1. Intellij Installation

```bash
yay -S intellij-idea-community-edition
```
2. Scala Plugin Installation
Go to **Marketplace** installation **Scala** Plugin. After that, Restart Intellij IDEA.
