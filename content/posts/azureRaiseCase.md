## Troubleshooting
### Permission Issue
If you face the error MSG at the below.
**You don't have permission to create a support request
To get permission, ask your subscription administrator or owner to assign you ‘Support Request Contributor’ role for the selected subscription. Learn more about role assignments in the portal.**

You need contact your subscription administrator or owner to assign the "support request provider" role to the subscription you are currently in used. After, you can raise support ticket.
