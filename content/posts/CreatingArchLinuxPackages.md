## Introduction {#introduction}

This article aims to assist users creating their own packages using the Arch Linux "ports-like" build system. It covers creation of a PKGBUILD â€“ a package build description file sourced by makepkg to create a binary package from source. If already in possession of a PKGBUILD, see makepkg. For instructions regarding existing rules and ways to improve package quality see Arch packaging standards.
