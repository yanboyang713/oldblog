# Getting Started with Org Roam - Build a Second Brain in Emacs

## Introduction
Org-roam is a plain-text knowledge management system. Org-roam is a tool for networked thought. It reproduces some of Roam Research’s 1 key features within Org-mode.

Org-roam borrows principles from the Zettelkasten method, providing a solution for non-hierarchical note-taking. It should also work as a plug-and-play solution for anyone already using Org-mode for their personal wiki.

Org-roam provides these benefits over other tooling:
+ **Privacy and Security**: Your personal wiki belongs only to you, entirely offline and in your control. Encrypt your notes with GPG.
+ **Longevity of Plain Text**: Unlike web solutions like Roam Research, the notes are first and foremost plain Org-mode files – Org-roam simply builds an auxiliary database to give the personal wiki superpowers. Having your notes in plain-text is crucial for the longevity of your wiki. Never have to worry about proprietary web solutions being taken down. The notes are still functional even if Org-roam ceases to exist.
+ **Free and Open Source**: Org-roam is free and open-source, which means that if you feel unhappy with any part of Org-roam, you may choose to extend Org-roam, or open a pull request.
+ **Leverage the Org-mode ecosystem**: Over the decades, Emacs and Org-mode has developed into a mature system for plain-text organization. Building upon Org-mode already puts Org-roam light-years ahead of many other solutions.
+ **Built on Emacs**: Emacs is also a fantastic interface for editing text, and Org-roam inherits many of the powerful text-navigation and editing packages available to Emacs.

## Installation
You can installing from MELPA or GitHub(Source). In this section, I will choose install Org-roam directly from the repository on GotHub. This will give you access to the latest version hours or days before it appears on MELPA, and months (or more) before it is added to the Debian or Ubuntu repositories. This will also give you access to various developmental branches that may be available.

Note, however, that development version, and especially any feature branches, may not always be in working order. You’ll need to be prepared to do some debugging, or to manually roll-back to working versions, if you install from GitHub.
