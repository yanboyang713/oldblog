What Is DevOps? It is a combination of practices that streamline the automation and integration of processes between the software development and IT teams. This will help them to build, test, and release software in a faster and more reliable way.
Purpose The term was formed by combining the words &ldquo;development&rdquo; and &ldquo;operations&rdquo; and signifies a cultural shift that helps bridge the gap between the development and operation teams.]]></description></item><item><title>Terraform Beginner's Guide</title><link>https://yanboyang.com/terraform/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 11:09:00 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://yanboyang.com/terraform/</guid><description>Overview In this blog post, I am going to cover a brief introduction of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Terraform, its lifecycle, and all the core concepts that every beginner should know. I have tried to cover all the topics in this beginner’s guide that will give you a quick start for using Terraform.

These two tools help in automating configurations and deploying infrastructure. Terraform offers to deploy Infrastructure as a Code, helps in readability and lift and shift deployments. Ansible is a configuration management tool for automating system configuration and management.
Terraform What is Terraform? Terraform is an open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure securely and effectively.</description></item><item><title>Build a Kubernetes cluster on Proxmox via Ansible and Terraform</title><link>https://yanboyang.com/k8sonproxmox/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 20:27:00 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://yanboyang.com/k8sonproxmox/</guid><description>Overview Proxmox is an open-source hypervisor that have enterprise capabilities and a large community behind it.
For Terraform and Ansible, i always like the idea of infrastructure as code (iac) and Terraform and Ansible just make it easy to accomplish.
The idea here was to be able to spin up a k3s cluster with minimum effort so i can spin it up and down for ever project that i would like to run.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started Dynamic Window Manager (DWM)</title><link>https://yanboyang.com/dwm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 17:50:00 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://yanboyang.com/dwm/</guid><description><![CDATA[Introduction Installing Install Xorg 1  pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit xorg-xrandr xorg-xsetroot   Install DWM 1 2 3  git clone git://git.suckless.org/dwm ~/.config/dwm git clone git://git.suckless.org/st ~/.config/st git clone git://git.suckless.org/dmenu ~/.config/dmenu   1 2 3  cd ~/.config/dwm &amp;&amp; sudo make install cd ~/.config/st &amp;&amp; sudo make install cd ~/.config/dmenu &amp;&amp; sudo make install   Installing a Display Manager (DM) 1 2 3 4 5  pacman -S lightdm pacman -S lightdm-gtk-greeter pacman -S lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings   Enable lightdm service 1  sudo systemctl enable lightdm   Adding an entry for DWM in the DM Create this file and add the following.]]></description></item><item><title>Gettting Started SRS(Simple Realtime Server)</title><link>https://yanboyang.com/srs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 11:43:00 +1100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://yanboyang.com/srs/</guid><description>Overview SRS is a simple, high efficiency and realtime video server, supports RTMP/WebRTC/HLS/HTTP-FLV/SRT.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started Configuring VLANs on Proxmox</title><link>https://yanboyang.com/vlan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 19:52:00 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://yanboyang.com/vlan/</guid><description>Introduction A virtualization server allows you to run multiple machines, virtual machines (VMs), on one physical device, also known as the host. There could be many different VMs each for different tasks. In this guide, we will discuss configuring your Proxmox virtualization server to use VLANs so that you can group related VMs onto their own subnet.
Motivation For security, as well as organizational purposes, physical machines are often separated on the network from each other by VLANs.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started ROS and Openwrt with Proxmox</title><link>https://yanboyang.com/rosandopenwrtproxmox/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 19:52:00 +1100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://yanboyang.com/rosandopenwrtproxmox/</guid><description>Install Open vSwitch Update the package index and then install the Open vSwitch packages by executing:
