** DONE Getting Started with Doom Emacs
CLOSED: [2021-10-05 Tue 03:44]

:END:
*** Prerequisites
**** Instation
***** Arch Linux
#+begin_src bash
# required dependencies
pacman -S git emacs ripgrep
# optional dependencies
pacman -S fd
yay -S emacs-pdf-tools-git
```
#+end_src

With Emacs and Doom’s dependencies installed, next is to install Doom Emacs itself:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
#+end_src

*** Sart-up
https://zzamboni.org/post/my-doom-emacs-configuration-with-commentary/

Install the icons to avoid having weird symbols.
*M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts*

*Note*: M-x is SPC :

Open a file

**SPC f f** OR *SPC .*

*** The bin/doom utility
This utility is your new best friend. It won’t spot you a beer, but it’ll shoulder much of the work associated with managing and maintaining your Doom Emacs configuration, and then some. Not least of which is installation of and updating Doom and your installed packages.

It exposes a variety of commands. *bin/doom* help will list them all, but here is a summary of the most important ones:

+ *doom sync*: This synchronizes your config with Doom Emacs. It ensures that needed packages are installed, orphaned packages are removed and necessary metadata correctly generated. Run this whenever you modify your doom! block or packages.el file. You’ll need doom sync -u if you override the recipe of package installed by another module.
+ *doom upgrade*: Updates Doom Emacs (if available) and all its packages.
doom env: (Re)generates an “envvar file”, which is a snapshot of your shell environment that Doom loads at startup. If your app launcher or OS launches Emacs in the wrong environment you will need this. **This is required for GUI Emacs users on MacOS.**
+ *doom doctor*: If Doom misbehaves, the doc will diagnose common issues with your installation, system and environment.
+ *doom purge*: Over time, the repositories for Doom’s plugins will accumulate. Run this command from time to time to delete old, orphaned packages, and with the -g switch to compact existing package repos.
Use doom help to see an overview of the available commands that doom provides, and doom help COMMAND to display documentation for a particular COMMAND.

I recommend you add a couple of *alias* to your ZSH configuration.
#+begin_example
# Doom Emacs
alias doomsync="$HOME/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync"
alias doomupgrade="$HOME/.emacs.d/bin/doom upgrade"
alias doomdoctor="$HOME/.emacs.d/bin/doom doctor"
alias doompurge="$HOME/.emacs.d/bin/doom purge"
alias doomclean="$HOME/.emacs.d/bin/doom clean"
alias doombuild="$HOME/.emacs.d/bin/doom build"
#+end_example

*** Doom config file overview
We already know how to open a file and how to use doom utility, so let's we take a overview for Doom configuration.

Doom Emacs at the least uses three config files.

+ *init.el* defines which of the existing Doom modules are loaded. A Doom module is a bundle of packages, configuration and commands, organized into a unit that can be toggled easily from this file. You also can design your own *Module*.
+ *packages.el* defines which packages should be installed, beyond those that are installed and loaded as part of the enabled modules.
+ *config.el* contains all custom configuration and code. when you have get so many configuration contains, you may need seperate for each category. There is a example. Click [[https://github.com/yanboyang713/doom.git][Here]]

There are other files that can be loaded, but theses are the main ones. The load order of different files is defined depending on the type of session being started.

**** Config file headers
We start by simply defining the standard headers used by the three files. These headers come from the initial files generated by doom install, and contain either some Emacs-LISP relevant indicators like lexical-binding, or instructions about the contents of the file.

+ init.el
+ packages.el
+ config.el

#+begin_example
;;; ../../dotfiles/doom/+research.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_example

**** Customized variables
Doom [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#configure][does not recommend the Emacs customize mechanism]] :

*Note*: do not use M-x customize or the customize API in general. Doom is designed to be configured programmatically from your config.el, which can conflict with Customize’s way of modifying variables.

All necessary settings are therefore set by hand as part of this configuration file. The only exceptions are “safe variable” and “safe theme” settings, which are automatically saved by Emacs in custom.el, but this is OK as they don’t conflict with anything else from the config.

*** General configuration
My user information.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Boyang Yan"
      user-mail-address "yanboyang713@gamil.com")
#+end_src

*** Projects with Projectile, File Explorer with Treemacs & EShell
**** Projectile
Doom Emacs have used package [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] to management our project.

*SPC p p* - Switch to project.
*SPC SPC* - Find a File in a project

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
projectile-project-search-path '("~/Project/" "~/dotfiles/" "~/blog/content-org/")
#+end_src

**** Treemacs
SPC o p - Open
When Treemacs is opened, you can type *q* to close.


** TODO Getting Started with send and receive Email with Doom Emacs
:PROPERTIES:

:EXPORT_OPTIONS: author:nil
:END:
Receive and send email (.mbsyncrc)
install
Install the isync package yaourt -S isync

Using GPG for mbsync passwords
The basic idea is that every time a password is needed, an particular file is decrypted and loaded. The key for the decryption can be prompted for and be stashed by gpg-agent. The first step is to create a GPG key, which is covered very well elsewhere. The standard authentication mechanism for gnus and smtpmail can be reused to store login information for mbsync. For any one account, the password for IMAP access and the password for sending email (usually the same) can be added to ~/.authinfo.gpg:

machine imap.gmail.com login MyAccountName@gmail.com password MYPASSWORD machine smtp.gmail.com login MyAccountName@gmail.com password MYPASSWORD The first line is used by mbsync and the second by smtpmail. The line: PassCmd “gpg2 -q –for-your-eyes-only –no-tty -d ~/.authinfo.gpg | awk ’machine imap.gmail.com login MyAccountName@gmail.com {print $NF}’”

*** What is artificial intelligence?
**** Explore into artificial intelligence
For the definition of artificial intelligence, academic research area always have different understandings. The widely accepted definition is:

+ *Artificial intelligence is the use of machines to simulate human cognitive abilities technology*.

Artificial intelligence involves a wide range of insights, learning, reasoning and decision-making.

From the perspective of industry application, the core ability of artificial intelligence ability is to make judgments or predictions based on given input.

The rise of deep learning and the three booms of AI.

***** Algorith
When you give a computer a task, you tell it not only what to do, but how to do it and a set of instructions about how to do it is called an algorithm.

+ Traditional algorithms -- traversal
+ Smarter algorithms -- gradient descent
+ More complex algorithms -- machine learning

***** Compute Resource/Power
 Breakthrough in computing power -- traditional CPU and new computing acceleration technology.

+ *Machine learning*: a way to achieve artificial intelligence

It is a multi-field interdisciplinary subject, involving probability theory, statistics, approximation theory, convex analysis, algorithm complexity theory and other subjects. Machine learning is the core of artificial intelligence, the fundamental way to make computers intelligent, and its applications are widespread
In all fields of artificial intelligence, it mainly uses induction and synthesis rather than deduction.

+ *Deep learning*: a technology that implements machine learning.

It uses a deep neural network to process the model more complex, so that the model has a deeper understanding of the data. It is a method of machine learning based on data representation learning. The motivation is to establish and simulate the human brain to analyzing the learning neural network, it imitates the mechanism of the human brain to interpret data, such as images, sounds and texts. The essence of deep learning is to learn more by building a machine learning model with many hidden layers and massive training data. Use the features to ultimately improve the accuracy of classification or prediction.

+ *Artificial neural network*: a machine learning algorithm

Neural networks generally have input layer -> hidden layer -> output layer. Generally speaking, a neural network with more than two hidden layers is called a deep neural network. Deep learning is a machine that uses a deep architecture like a deep neural network. Learn method.

***** What is machine Learning
*Artificial intelligence is a technology that uses machines to simulate human cognitive abilities*.

+ Traditional artificial intelligence methods: logical reasoning, expert systems (answering questions based on manually defined rules), etc.;

+ Contemporary artificial intelligence generally acquires the ability to make predictions and judgments through learning-machine learning

sensor:
1. External stimulation passes through nerve endings and turns converted into electrical signals, transduced to nerve cells (Also called neuron)
2. Numerous neurons form the nerve center
3. The nerve center integrates various signals to do judgement.
4. According to the instructions of the nerve center, the human body respond to external stimuli.

****** How does the machine think? --Artificial neural networks
