# Models for Stationary Time Series


## Introduction {#introduction}

We will focus on general linear processes, moving average processes, autoregressive processes, the mixed Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models and invertibility. These concepts provide the required basis for one of the frequently used ARMA methodology. We will have hands-on tasks to deepen your understanding of ARMA models and improve your skillsets for the implementation of time series analysis methods.
