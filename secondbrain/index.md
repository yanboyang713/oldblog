# Building a Second Brain: Capturing, Organizing, and Sharing Knowledge for Scholars and Researchers


## Introduction {#introduction}

Building a Second Brain is about creating a reliable system – outside your physical skin-and-bone bodily boundaries – for storing, organising, digesting, and eventually transforming information into Good Creative Output.

Much like any well-integrated tool, I am currently using **Emacs Org Mode** as Second Brain **core** tool. This system also includes many other peripheral components that make up the complete **Second Brain** system.

I will follow the below overview diagram introducte each components one by one.
