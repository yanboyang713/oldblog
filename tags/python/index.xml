What are they and what are they used for? This article will be a beginner’s guide to virtual environments and dependency managers in Python. We will also look at five of the most used dependency managers in Python.
A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment where a project’s dependencies are installed in a different directory from those installed in the system’s default Python path and other virtual environments.</description></item><item><title>Replacing Bash Scripting with Python</title><link>https://yanboyang.com/bashscriptingwithpython/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 06:11:32 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://yanboyang.com/bashscriptingwithpython/</guid><description>Introduction</description></item><item><title>Getting started with Python using Conda</title><link>https://yanboyang.com/conda/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 06:11:32 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://yanboyang.com/conda/</guid><description>Introduction This post document is about using Conda to management Python and R language packages (libraries/dependencies), as well as virtual environment. Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system. Conda can quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language.</description></item><item><title>Getting started with Basler Camera With Opencv on Python</title><link>https://yanboyang.com/baslerwithopencv/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 06:11:32 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://yanboyang.com/baslerwithopencv/</guid><description>Introduction This post document is about using Basler Camera with Opencv on Python. At the beginning of this guide I will introduct how to set-up development environment with Pylon and opencv within Conda virual environment. Seconly, I will talk about how to check and set some of basic Basler feature base on pypylon. At the end, I will give a example about using Opencv read Basler Camera data stream.
Hardware and Software Testing Environment Hardware Environment Camera: Basler (a2A1920 - 51gcPRO) Network Adapter: Intel I350 Gigabit Network adapter (POE) CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700F CPU @ 3.</description></item></channel></rss>
