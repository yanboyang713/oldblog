Mininet hosts run standard Linux network software, and its switches support OpenFlow for highly flexible custom routing and Software-Defined Networking.
Mininet supports research, development, learning, prototyping, testing, debugging, and any other tasks that could benefit from having a complete experimental network on a laptop or other PC.
Mininet:
Provides a simple and inexpensive network testbed for developing OpenFlow applications Enables multiple concurrent developers to work independently on the same topology Supports system-level regression tests, which are repeatable and easily packaged Enables complex topology testing, without the need to wire up a physical network Includes a CLI that is topology-aware and OpenFlow-aware, for debugging or running network-wide tests Supports arbitrary custom topologies, and includes a basic set of parametrized topologies is usable out of the box without programming, but also Provides a straightforward and extensible Python API for network creation and experimentation.</description></item></channel></rss>
