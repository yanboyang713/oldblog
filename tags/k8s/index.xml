For Terraform and Ansible, I always like the idea of infrastructure as code (iac) and Terraform and Ansible just make it easy to accomplish.
The idea here was to be able to spin up a k3s cluster with minimum effort so I can spin it up and down for ever project that I would like to run.</description></item></channel></rss>
