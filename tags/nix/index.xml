Flakes replace stateful channels (which cause much confusion among novices) and introduce a more intuitive and consistent CLI, making them a perfect opportunity to start using Nix.
It contains examples and advice on using flakes for a real-life use case: building applications in various languages.

It also helps to test and deploy software systems while using the functional programming paradigm. There is a vast repository of packages for Nix called nixpkgs, and a GNU/Linux distribution that extends the ideas of Nix to the OS level called NixOS.</description></item></channel></rss>
