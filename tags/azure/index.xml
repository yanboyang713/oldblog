DSVM will be your best option as your develop environment base on cloud. DSVM helps in flexible virtualization without the need for purchasing and maintenance of hardware. You will see the DSVM highlights at the below section. DSVM almost cover all of popular tools for data science.</description></item><item><title>Azure Machine Learning Compute Instance Getting Started</title><link>http://example.org/amlci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 06:11:32 +1000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://example.org/amlci/</guid><description>Introduction This post document is a brief introduction about Azure Machine Learning Service Compute Instance(CI). CI can be as your development environment or training compute tartget. TIPS: However, if your specialty on Linux, I recommand you using DSVM ({% post_link DSVM %}) as your development environment. For training process, I recommand you using Azure Machine Learning training cluster(Compute cluster).
