In this quickstart, you learn how to create a virtual network. After creating a virtual network, you deploy two VMs into the virtual network. You then connect to the VMs from the internet, and communicate privately over the new virtual network.
Create a resource group and a virtual network Before you can create a virtual network, you have to create a resource group to host the virtual network.</description></item><item><title>Azure Machine Learning</title><link>https://yanboyang.com/aml/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 06:11:32 +1000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://yanboyang.com/aml/</guid><description>Create a new Azure Machine Learning I recommand you create a new AML workspace use an Azure Resource Manager Template from Azure CLI. The Azure Resource Manager template can be found in the 201-machine-learning-advanced in GitHub repository.
This template creates the following Azure services, all those various services are required by the Azure Machine Learning workspace:
