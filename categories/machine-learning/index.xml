Data expansion is a common method for training models, which is very important for the robustness and accuracy of the model. This post document will use OpenCV to show some of tips for how we can extented image training set.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning Workflow</title><link>http://example.org/machinelearningworkflow/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 06:11:32 +1000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://example.org/machinelearningworkflow/</guid><description>Machine Learning Development Liftcycle Overview There are two important parts for ML lifecycle (pipeline).
Data-flow about how to management/store your data and how to transfer your data in your ML lifecycle. Transfer your data highly regarding with Networking, so in this post, I will talk a little bit about Network Topologgy from On-premises network to Azure Network Topology. Compute Resources/Environments about how to compute your data on each steps, different steps are running within different environments.</description></item></channel></rss>
