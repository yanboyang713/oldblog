For Terraform and Ansible, i always like the idea of infrastructure as code (iac) and Terraform and Ansible just make it easy to accomplish.
The idea here was to be able to spin up a k3s cluster with minimum effort so i can spin it up and down for ever project that i would like to run.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started Configuring VLANs on Proxmox</title><link>https://yanboyang.com/vlan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 19:52:00 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://yanboyang.com/vlan/</guid><description>Introduction A virtualization server allows you to run multiple machines, virtual machines (VMs), on one physical device, also known as the host. There could be many different VMs each for different tasks. In this guide, we will discuss configuring your Proxmox virtualization server to use VLANs so that you can group related VMs onto their own subnet.
Motivation For security, as well as organizational purposes, physical machines are often separated on the network from each other by VLANs.</description></item></channel></rss>
